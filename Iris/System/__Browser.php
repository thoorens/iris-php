              Dillo

              A very (like < 500K dowload) very lightweight FLTK-based browser. Seems to run only on *nix (and the out-of-box DragonflyBSD and DSL - Damn Small Linux - choice).

              Explanation: Dillo 2.2 running under Puppy Linux 4.3 (not that you would pick that up from the string!) This version includes CSS support and tabs and finally renders the zytrax site - perfectly. Always the sign of a great browser we think. String from Jake Wasdin - thanks.

              Dillo/0.8.6

              Firefox

              Phoenix is dead - long live Firebird. Firebird is dead - long live Firefox. Firebird/Phoenix has morph'd into Firefox. The Mozilla roadmap shows Firefox as the browser for the next generation of Mozilla. Essentially (if we can paraphrase a very big page) the mozilla design team are saying that they will develop a set of components (browser, mail client, editor (composer) and others) which will work well together but will have their own development priorities and timeframes, rather than the current monolithic Mozilla structure. The historic Phoenix and Firebird strings are still on the main page 'cos we like to remind 'em of their humble beginnings. Note: For Firefox 3 and perhaps after, Minefield will remain the development version and always have 'pre' in the string, whereas GranParadiso is the release leg and will not have 'pre' in the string - so there you go. Shiretoko named for the Japanese Peninsula and a UN world heritage site (aren't we the smart ones) seems to be the development release leg for 3.5 - replacing GranParadiso? While Namoroka (a unique nature reserve in northeastern Madagascar) seems to be the 3.6 development release leg.

              The 'mobile Firefox' is being developed under the current codename of Fennec (a small noctunal fox found in the Sahara desert) - man, who comes up with these names. But don't worry they'll change the name 427 times before release. Multi-platform - Linux and Windows Mobile so far.

              Don't forget the Mozilla SeaMonkey project about which which J. Reynolds writes:

              The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of code derived from the application formerly known as "Mozilla Application Suite". Whereas the main focus of the Mozilla Foundation is on Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird, our group of dedicated volunteers works to ensure that you can have "everything but the kitchen sink" and have it stable enough for corporate use.

              Note: The seamonkey strings are under Mozilla.

              Nathan Lineback supplied this reference to a bunch of screen shots showing the OS's to which Firefox (1.5 mostly) has been ported.

              Windows FF users may want to check out palemoon which claims to be up to 25% faster than the moz port by optimizing the FF code base for Windows.

              This represents the current and major historic release versions of the strings - well in our unbalanced judgment. We maintain a separate page with a complete list of Firefox strings that we have ever found or received (including some really bizarre stuff) - includes those on this page.

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; Google Wireless Transcoder;)

              Explanation: This is a google service that acts as a proxy and converts web sites to a mobile format - somewhat controversial because it seems to drop its own adsense data to make it all fit better and downgrade to Moz 4. Same string also appears under MSIE since it pretends to be MSIE6.x. String from Lucy Thao and Venkatesh Mohan - thanks.

Apache's Jakarta project also features something called HTTPClient - thanks to Joe Francis for the update - and we feature both strings below. Application could be a browser if you so wished or an e-mail harvester or whatever. HTTPClient We featured this string in our mystery section and still do.

And EMCA script (Javascript 1.3). available for windows and *nix (and uses that jolly clever startkit idea from those Tcl/TK folks).

              Explanation: Hv3 on kubuntu Hardy. While the string includes Gecko it does not use the Gecko rendering engine. The SUSE part of the string may be related to the fact that this was a binary install. String from Jake Wasdin - thanks.

              Browser supplied with JBuilder. Since its all Java based it may be a development of the origonal HotJava browser which I thought was great (eh!) for its time.

              ICE Browser/5.05 (Java 1.4.0; Windows 2000 5.0 x86)

              Explanation: ICE 5.05 on Windows 2000 or NT 5.0 if you prefer. The lack of Mozilla compatability will catch most browser detect functions.

              Kazehakase

              Don't ask us how you pronounce it. Lightweight browser for *nix Ã  la Epiphany/Galeon. Tabbed browsing and RSS plus some nifty mouse features (Opera like). Plans to allow multiple rendering engines (bit like Epihany).

              Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko Kazehakase/0.5.4 Debian/0.5.4-2.1ubuntu3

              Kkman

              Not being fluent in Manadarin Chinese or Taiwanese (or even Hakka) we have no idea about the feature set of this browser - but its home page has vaguely firefox like graphics but the string looks like a skinned version of Explorer.

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; KKman2.0)

              K-Meleon

              Lightweight version of Mozilla. Runs on Windows only. The windows download of this baby is still around 7.5MB. That's light. Keeps bookmarks and favorites (and Hotlists for you ex-Opera users) separate, fast to load and spawn new pages, tiny footprint, tabbed (layered) browsing, and now even prints well! Uses the Gecko rendering engine from Mozilla. Still our browser of choice on windows. No contest. Apparently Mozilla no longer provides an embeddable version of Gecko so development of K-meleon has been suspended. When HTML5 becomes a fully fledged standard we may have to change browser - we estimate somewhere around 2080. Update: Development has restarted (2014'ish).

              Links

              Another mostly text browser. JÃ¼rgen Starek contibuted this explanation of the difference between Links and Lynx. We have taken some liberties with the summary - errors are ours not JÃ¼rgen's.

              Links can render Tables and Frames
              Links does a better job of rendering color
              Lynx integrates better with scripts Perl etc.
              Links has a graphical option.

              So there you go.

              There appear to be two versions of Links. Version 1 can be obtained from the link above and now version 2 (has more graphic content than v1) which can be downloaded from here.

              Links (2.8; Linux 3.19.0-21-generic i686; GNU C 4.8.3; text)

All that Web 2.0 stuff that turns 5 lines of text into a 250K download. Now that really progress.

              Mosaic

              The browser that started it all. Groundbreaking stuff in its day. All modern browsers owe their interface to this browser (and probably code also!). Archive version only at the above link.

              PATHWORKS Mosaic/1.0 libwww/2.15_Spyglass

              Explanation: From Nathan "PATHWORKS Mosaic is a WIN32s Win3.1 version of Mosaic licensed and modified by Digital Equipment Corporation and bundled with their PATHWORKS networking software". String from Nathan Lineback - thanks.

              VMS_Mosaic/3.8-1 (Motif;OpenVMS V7.3-2 DEC 3000 - M700) libwww/2.12_Mosaic

              Explanation: We can do no better than quote George Cook who supplied the string "VMS Mosaic 3.8-1 is a direct descendant of NCSA Mosaic 2.7b5 (the final release of NCSA's Mosaic for X11). It only runs on the VMS operating systems and is still under active development. It supports HTML V4 but does not support Java or Javascript. The ID string is from using it on a DEC 3000-700 Alpha running OpenVMS V7.3-2. The source and more info is available". String from George Cook - thanks.

              NCSA_Mosaic/2.7b5 (X11;Linux 2.6.7 i686) libwww/2.12 modified

              Explanation: Version of Mosaic running on Mandrake 10.0 Official. Andrew reckons its still pretty useable but with a slightly old fashioned look 'n feel. The browser could not handle our submisson form and other stuff like div - we guess it supports a pretty basic HTML 2.0 or earlier dialect . String from Andrew Preater - thanks.

              mMosaic/3.6.6 (X11;SunOS 5.8 sun4m)

              Mozilla (SeaMonkey)

              The name given to the all-in-one package with browser, email and composer (development code name is Seamonkey).

              MS Explorer

              The 900 pound gorilla of the browser business. IE 10 is currently (2011) being previewed on windows 7. MSIE 9.0 is now released - if you are using Vista or 7 (or you can hang onto IE 8.0) . And for XP you have a choice of IE6, 7 or 8. And for the rest of us - tough. Seems Trident is the MS rendering engine name (since IE8?) - the equivalent of Opera's Presto and Moz's Gecko. Microsoft's MSIE history page (Link from Riley McArdle - thanks).

              There are also strings for Windows CE/IEMobile in this section for those of a curious disposition (and yes, they should be in the mobile section. What do you expect - consistency?).

              Information about recognizing media center embedded in browser. From Rob Lehew - thanks.

              This represents the current and major historic release versions of the strings - well, in our unbalanced judgment. We maintain a separate page with a complete list of MS Internet Explorer strings that we have ever found or received (including some really bizarre stuff) - includes those on this page.

              Explanation: Microsoft Internet Explorer 11.0 (32-bit) on Windows 8 (64 bit). Fascinating string - the version number is defined by the "rv" parameter and the "like Gecko" - shades of Chrome. String from Deyan Markov - thanks.

              Explanation: Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.0 (64-bit version) on Windows 7 (64 bit) - the three strings from the top are in normal IE9 mode, in IE8 mode and IE7 mode. Two items to note. First, IE9 removes all the .net stuff (security concerns). Second, the inclusion of the Tablet PC string (indicating support for the late, unlamented Windows Tablet specification?).

              Netscape

              Netscape is no more. The netscape page now states that official support ended on 1st March 2008 though you can still download release 9, 8, 7 and the venerable 4 from the site. They recommend using Firefox or Flock (interesting). The last Version 9 was called Navigator again which as Deyan Mavrov reminded us is the first time they used the name since NS4.x (now that was a release). Since version 8 they used the firefox base with their own stuff added and a very slick graphic design (IOHO). Previous versions used the full Mozilla build (now seamonkey). Wonder who uses it - we guess it's just folks who have always used Netscape. End of an era. Sigh.

              This represents the current and major historic release versions of the strings - well, in our unbalanced judgment. We maintain a separate page with a complete list of Netscape strings that we have ever found or received (including some really bizarre stuff) - includes those on this page.

              Omniweb

              Omniweb is a browser for MAC OS X (yeah they got lots of choices too - its not just you PC guys). Omniweb, from version 5.9, is now as free as a bird (they used to have one of those try - then buy policies - but no more). No doubt about it IOHO the quality of Apple and Apple vendor web pages is a cut above the normal. Omniweb since version 4.5 release uses the embedded OS X KHTML rendering engine rather than its own.

              Opera

              Note: Opera V5+ had a free download. Opera 5 and 6 had quirky Javascript/DOM support. Opera 7 set a whole new (excellent) standard now continued with Opera 8, 9 and 10. And we just loved that Aqua skin. Watch these strings because you can select a variety of user agent strings with this browser. If at first you don't succeed - try another user agent id. Copious email from Opera lovers indicates the default for 10 is now the Opera native string - grave error in our opinion (see also comments for the version 10/9.80 wheeze below). Section now includes some Opera Mobile/Mini strings. Some more Opera Mobile strings can also be found under various PDAs and phones in the mobile page. Presto (as in Hey, Presto!) is the Opera rendering engine - their version of Gecko or Webkit or Trident - which does make it a tad easier to recognize. Glossy new interface with version 11 where we could not find out where to change the home screen url. Sigh. And why do they always cloak any manufacturer's info in their strings? For those who are keen to know about these things Opera Mobile is typically targetted at modern smartphones and renders the pages directly (just like regular Opera) whereas Opera Mini needs some help from an Opera server to render the page and is typically targetted at lower function featurephones. The code base for the main browser (running on windows etc.) now (from release 15?) uses webkit/chromium with Opera customization on top (and is identified by the string OPR/XX.XX.XX.XX, whereas Opera Mini continues to use the Presto engine code base.

              Explanation: Wget 1.6 (GNU HTTP/FTP tool) on Linux Mandrake 8.0. Is this the same as WebGet? - no its not! WebGet is available here but seems to do roughly the same thing though I'm sure neither Wget nor WebGet folks would agree with that statement.

              Life on the edge

              Yeah well. Most of us use MS Windows or Linux on pretty normal Intel or PPC architectures but there are some people who like to live on the edge.
             * Here is the modest "life on the edge" strings list.

              Browser Help Objects

              This section shows strings from a number of plug-ins or proxy services whose job in life (they have decided) is to help (maybe) the user as they meander throughout the 'net. We are going to try and build a list with links to the plug-in site and - with your help - categorise them both as to how they get installed - e.g. willing user or stealth and wheter they are benign or nasty. In may cases we just show the additional string that will result rather than a full browser string - we're not gonna install nasty things just for your information now are we - well not willingly we're not!

              ..FunWebSearch...

              Explanation: MyWebSearch (or FunWebProducts enhanced browser - not classified as sypware or adware. To remove it - go here. Info from Chris Gulutz - thanks.

              Explanation: IDZap enhanced browser. OK its done a good job and just defeated every browser detection string - now what.

              Explanation: Life behind a junkbuster proxy. This is MSIE 5.0 on a Windows'95 PC - pretty obvious really! String from Phil Hibbs - thanks.

              String from Remco de Vijlder. Axel Kollmorgen and Eugene Sadhu suggest that it is most likely EasySearchBar (ESB - geddit). Jim Rofkar and Eugene Sadhu both add another possibility - Easy Start Bar for laptops. Thanks guys.
              Page Validation Services

              Page validation services are great until you try 'em with dynamically generated pages based on the browser - then you gotta know what they send.

              WDG_Validator/1.6.1

              Explanation: The Web Design Groups (WDG) page validator service tool they also have great material on HTML and CSS as well on their site. String from Peter Booth - thanks.

              Potentially Unpleasant Things

              These strings or partial strings may have unknown side effects or be downright malicious depending on who is using them. You may want to know about 'em when they are visiting.

              vobsub

              Explanation: Contributed by Jan Praestkjaer. A CD ripping plug-in. More information may obtained here.

              DigExt

              Explanation: Contributed by John Bridges. 'DigExt' can appear in a MSIE browser string and is potentially pretty nasty. If you ask for content to be available off-line in certain versions of MSIE (we saw it on 5.0 and 4.x) then MSIE will grab a lot of stuff from the sites you visit and slave it in its temporary internet files. Pretty unpleasant stuff since it chews up your and the sites bandwidth. Sounds like a nice option but MS don't tell you the consequences. Now if I just knew where the option was I'd disable it but since I just upgraded to MSIE 6.0 (cos my 5.0 kept crashing after I refused an automatic update - any connection!! Oh and by the way in case you think we are prejudiced we also upgraded to NS6) I can't find any of this stuff and my browser string doesn't show 'DigExt' anymore - is this another mystery! If you are interested to get more info on the pernicious 'DigExt' John provided this link.

              This may have morphed in the first string shown under the MSIE list - it contains 'MSIECrawler' - thanks to Adam Hauner.

              Mystery Strings and Questions

              Anyone read, we think, Polish and use a cell phone if so you can probably answer this:

              holmes/3.10.1 (OnetSzukaj/5.0; +http://szukaj.onet.pl)

              Submitted by David Ross (thanks). Answer from Michal Malek. Apparently it is a polish search engine crawler from OnetSzukaj. Many thanks. And he didn't need a cell phone.
              Anyone recognize the IEMB3 in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322;
              IEMB3; IEMB3)

              Submitted by Ineke K (thanks). The most plausible explanation is IE Mobile Browser but with a 7.0 version?
              Anyone recognize this string:

              Bookdog/3.11.4

              This one was submitted and answered by David Ross (thanks). Its BookDog (which apparently replaces Safari Sniffer) and can organize/validate bookmarks for Safari, Camino and Firefox on the Mac. It replaces the normal User-Agent string rather that adds to it which is normal mode for BHO and Plugins - pretty strange even if not a true mystery.
              Anyone recognize this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; BT [build 60A];
              .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

              Any ideas about the BT [build 60A] string? String from John Dobson.

              Alexander Twigg thinks this is the British Telecom Yahoo! browser based on MSIE 6 - and who are we to dispute that - many thanks Alexander.
              Anyone recognize this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows 98; Config C)

              Any ideas about the Config C string? String from John Dobson.
              Anyone recognize this string:

              Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051123
              Firefox/1.5 (977517da3442c5cr5yba8n969bd36a6c7e5a)

              Any ideas about the string following Firefox? String from Ryan J.
              Anyone recognize this string:

              KDDI-CA31 UP.Browser/6.2.0.7.3.129 (GUI) MMP/2.0

              We suspected it was some kind of Japanese mobile device (IP tracked to Internet Multifeed Co. of Japan). String from David E. Ross. Yeah it's a DoCoMo device. Answer from karawapo who also supplied a huge list of DoCoMo devices.
              Anyone recognize the Secure IE in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1;
              .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Secure IE 3.3.1286)

              String from Lewis Kapell. Possible answer also from Lewis is Secure IE (surprise, surprise).
              Anyone recognize the i-NavFourF in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; i-NavFourF;
              .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

              String from maffiou. Possible answer also from maffiou is the i-van system from Verisign, Inc. which allows International names in URLs (including DNS). More possibiliies here. Confirmed by Andreas StÃ¤ding.
              Anyone recognize the TIMET-040122 in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0; TIMET-0904;
              TIMET-040122)

              String from D. Latham.
              Anyone recognize the 'AT&T CMS7.0'in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; AT&T CSM7.0;
              .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Hotbar 4.6.1)

              String from Brantley Harris. The hotbar is clearly our good friends hotbar who monitor your traffic. You can remove it here. But the CMS... Turns out it's AT&T Worldnet Customer Support Manager v7.0. Update from Don Beele - thanks.
              Anyone recognize the 'iebar'in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; iebar)

              String from Willem van Nunen. Its, suprisingly, iebar now why didn't we think about that ('cos we're stupid, that's why). Answer from Chip Downs - thanks.
              Anyone recognize the CS 2000 in this string:

              Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:0.9.4.2)
              Gecko/20021112 CS 2000 7.0/7.0

              String from Willem van Nunen. Answer from Richard Aspden it is "the CompuServe 2000 application, which had Gecko built-in. AOL was going to do the same with it's own native software (AOL owning CS), but decided to use IE in the end anyway.". Many thanks.
              Anyone recognize the ESB stuff in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0;
              ESB{A8417D9D-5087-4807-9D73-9E09290256CD})

              String from Remco de Vijlder. Axel Kollmorgen, Eugene Sadhu and Jim Rofkar all made suggestions - we moved this one to the BHO section with the best links we can find. Oracle's Fusion Middleware Enterprise Service Bus?
              Anyone recognize the DIL0001021 in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; DIL0001021)

              String from John Dobson. Answer: Seems is Demon Internet Limited a big UK ISP who customize MSIE. From Lee Harvey Osmond - thanks - who also wants to know what 'YPC' means in a string.
              Anyone recognize the H010818 in this string:

              Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+5.5;+Windows+NT+4.0;+H010818)

              String from Jim Rofkar. Possible Answer: From Eugene Sadhu "Interestingly this string "H010818" is found in the registry of WinME machines and may have some correlation to the WindowsUpdate App. Perhaps a browser used after visiting the WindowsUpdate site will send this string to other machines on the same session. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\User Agent\Post Platform\H010818" Many thanks.
              Anyone recognize this CLSID like string in a browser:

              Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0;+
              {4E449FBB-3E07-4F3B-AF93-9F441086A756};+.NET+CLR+1.1.4322)
              Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+6.0;+Windows+NT+5.0;+
              {8E13D179-78A2-4C06-9BFC-EA5BF2EE1750})

              String from Jim Rofkar - followed by the answer from Jim also. These may indicate the browser has a BHO (Browser Helper Object) software installed (perhaps unwittingly) from either LOP foistware (site link appears broken) or WurlMedia. This site seems to keep a reasonably up-to-date list of nasty things. If you think you have got some nasty stuff on your browser just type 'hijack' into a google search and follow the most promising links.

              ...SURF...

              Anyone know what application the word SURF in a browser string comes from? String from Erik Nelson. Tyler Bannister writes" One of our students is having a problem with her browser pre-fetching every page she reads in Internet Explorer. The problem doesn't occur in Netscape, thus it seems likely that "SURF" is some type of browser help object for IE and probably malware" - thanks - anyone got more on this one?

              Mozilla/4.01 (Compatible; Acorn Phoenix 2.08 [intermediate]; RISC OS 4.39) Acorn-HTTP/0.84

              Anyone know what the browser being used is? String from Erik ?. Updated answer from Chris Bazley. Apparently the original Acorn Browse in a development version morphed into Phoenix (not to be confused with the pre firebird pre firefox mozilla browser!) on the ACORN RISC OS. For all you ACORN fans however seems there may be a Firefox port called Rozilla.
              Anyone recognize this one:

              mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 6.0; windows 98; ypc 3.0.2; yplus 4.4.01d)

              Anyone know what the ypc and yplus is? String from Bruce Preston.

              Answer: It's Yahoo Parental Controls which seems to be available to you if you sign-up with Yahoo. Answer from John Pye - thanks.
              Anyone recognize this one:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; FREE; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

              Anyone know what the FREE is? String from Jean Christophe Olivain. Axel Kollmorgen writes "seems to be a customized version of IE made by free.fr or a related company. all the "FREE" agents in my logs are from france and their ip's related somehow with free.fr". Thanks Axel. Confirmation from Symon Rottem who says that the isp free provides an installation CD with a customised version of MSIE. This one is now dead - maybe we should move to the MSIE strings.
              Anyone recognize this one:

              Mozilla/4.5 RPT-HTTPClient/0.3-2

              We suspect this may be an e-mail extractor program, but we could be wrong. Anyone got a definitive answer? String from Michael Wilcox.

              Answer: It's an HTTP client library. Answer from Eugene Sadhu - thanks.
              Anyone recognize the KTXN part of this string:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; KTXN)

              Anyone got any idea? String from Chug Yang.

              Answer: KTXN is "Keynote" a website monitoring service. Keynote traffic (evidenced by presence of KTXN in the user agent string) should not be blocked from your web server (because then your reported availability % will be zero!) but it should not be included in your pageviews/visits/etc measurements since that is not real customers' traffic. Answer from Justin Grant - thanks.
              Anyone recognize this one:

              SUNPlex 4.1 (Trusted Solaris 8 Operating Environment; Solaris 8 OE; Sun Fire 15K)

              Seems to be from a SUN Secure cluster - benign application or something more sinister? String from Erik's ? logs.

              We got this in response: "SUNPlex Manager is a web-based administration tool for the SunCluster 3 clustering software. Trusted Solaris is a secured version of the Solaris operating system (I believe it at one point was rated C2 in the Orange Book but I don't know for sure what it is now). Sun Fire 15K is the Godzilla of servers, one of my favorite machines to work on, and makes one awesomungus web browser." Thanks to Joe George.
              Anyone recognize this one:

              Mozilla/3.0 (compatible; HP Web PrintSmart 04b0 1.0.1.34)

              String from Dan Johnson's logs.

              Answer: Eugene Sadhu writes "HP Web PrintSmart software is a tool for creating custom printed documents from Web pages that you retrieve from anywhere on the Web." His view is its probably not available now (we checked and could only a historic reference n HP's pages). Thanks Eugene.
              Anyone recognize this one:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.0; Win3.1; ATHMWWW1.1;)

              String from Dan Johnsons logs. MSIE 5.0 does not run on windows 3.1 so its something else. Just someone playing with browsers ids? Whenever we are categorical about something you can bet we're wrong. Turns out MSIE 5 can run on Windows 3.1 - answer from Bennett Hatchett - many thanks. ATHWWW1.1 looks to us like the @Home browser a ex-internet cable company that was big in the late 90s.

              Answer: This is the browser string from Excite@home's custom browser so we suspect is version 3.1 runing on a Windows platform - anyone know the base technology e.g. custom MSIE or what. Answer from Eugene Sadhu - thanks.
              Anyone recognize this one:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

              Answer: Neal Blomfield writes "The following user agent string listed as a mystery string on your website looks like IE6 on Win2k running both verion 1 (.NET CLR 1.0.3705) and version 1.1 (.NET CLR 1.1.4322) of the .NET framework". Sounds plausible to us. Thanks Neal. Bobby Mcgee also provided this link http://www.httprevealer.com/usage_dotnet.htm to help identify folks using the .NET infrastructure. Thanks Bobby.
              What does 'DigExt' mean (solved - credit to John Bridges see here).
              Anyone recognize the browser or OS:

              Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; ICS 1.2.105)

              Answer: Marc Schneider suggests it's probably from Novell's Internet Caching system. We also got confirmation of this from Eugene Sadhu "It is most probably from the Compaq TaskSmart C-Series server, in fact, one that had the upgrade patch to build 1.2.105 installed (released 15 Sep 2000)" Mystery solved - thanks guys.
              Anyone know what the 'U' is in many Linux browser strings.
              Answer: From Rickard Anglerud - thanks: It defines security level and may have one of the following values:
              N for no security
              U for strong security
              I for weak security
